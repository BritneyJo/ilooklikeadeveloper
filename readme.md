### About This Event

According to a Department of Labor Current Population Survey, only 34% of all web developers are women. Itâ€™s time to change those statistics. Entry level junior developers earn an average of $50,000-70,000 per year, and often have flexibility to work from home. We want women all over the world to take advantage of these industry benefits.

In an effort to get women interested in coding and empowered to pursue work they love, General Assembly is partnering with several organizations to host a night of coding and fellowship. Come hear a panel of top female developers discuss how they got started in the industry, what an average day looks like, which coding languages to learn, and more. Then, take the first step toward becoming a master developer by writing your first line of code!
